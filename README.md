MarsPhotos - Starter Code
==================================

Starter code for [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

Introduction
------------

In the previous codelab, you learned how to get data from a web service and parse the response into a Kotlin object. In this codelab, you build on that knowledge to load and display photos from a web URL. You also revisit how to build a RecyclerView and use it to display a grid of images on the overview page.

Pre-requisites
--------------
- How to create and use fragments.
- How to retrieve JSON from a REST web service and parse that data into Kotlin objects using the Retrofit and Moshi libraries.
- How to construct a grid layout with a RecyclerView.
- How Adapter, ViewHolder, and DiffUtil work.

What you'll learn
-----------------
How to use the Coil library to load and display an image from a web URL.
How to use a RecyclerView and a grid adapter to display a grid of images.
How to handle potential errors as the images download and display.

What you'll build
-----------------
- Modify the MarsPhotos app to get the image URL from the Mars data, and use Coil to load and display that image.
- Add a loading animation and error icon to the app.
- Use a RecyclerView to display a grid of Mars images.
- Add status and error handling to the RecyclerView.

What you need
-------------
- A computer with a modern web browser, such as the latest version of Chrome.
- Internet access on your computer.
